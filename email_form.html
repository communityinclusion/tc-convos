<p><strong>Welcome to Think College Conversations!</strong><br>
We hope that this online discussion tool will allow you to get information and support from others when you need it! Group members who commit to asking questions AND responding to others will make the discussion lively and useful.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started:</strong><br>
The first thing you should do is follow the directions you received from Slack to join Think College Conversations. Slack offers many helpful tools for new users. Of particular interest may be the app, which can be downloaded on your desktop or any mobile device to allow immediate access to ongoing dialogue.   </p>

<p>Next, join the topic-driven channel or channels that interest you and introduce yourself. Check in periodically and chime in to keep the conversations flowing. We will keep an eye on things, and plan to host &quot;coffee hour&quot; type events, where we can all be online together and have a more dynamic, real-time conversation. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see a specific topic that you&#39;re interested in, post your comments or questions in the #general channel.</p>

<p><strong>Our Goals for this Community</strong><br>
The Think College National Coordinating Center wants to facilitate meaningful connections within our community and beyond. We want you to feel comfortable asking for help, starting a conversation, and collaborating with others. The purpose of these discussion channels is to break down typical barriers to networking, communication, and organization by offering an accessible space to share ideas and work together. By sharing successes and discussing struggles, we hope to all grow as a community and improve and expand the opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities to have meaningful postsecondary experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Your Responsibilities</strong>
Basically, we just ask that you play nice! Also, try to stay engaged: these conversations won&#39;t be as helpful if you don&#39;t participate. There is a formal code of conduct below; however, the bottom line is to treat others as you wish to be treated. Be kind and considerate, and be respectful of others in the group. Conduct yourself as you would in any professional venue. </p>

<p>If you have any issues or questions, contact us at thinkcollege@umb.edu. Thanks for joining us!</p>

<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong><br>
Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand. Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful, and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
