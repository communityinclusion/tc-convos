<p>Sometimes the best way to learn is to simply connect with other people who do what you do. To facilitate this connection, Think College has set up online communication – where you can easily reach out to others about a particular topic or area of interest. These online groups are hosted on a real-time chat platform called <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a>.</p>  
<p>Slack works like an instant messaging board with “channels” that categorize conversation by topic. Everything is easily searchable and the tool supports direct messaging to any member of the group. These online discussion groups are a safe place for like-minded (or like-employed) individuals to connect.</p>

<p>Slack offers many helpful tools for new users. Of particular interest may be the app, which can be downloaded on your desktop or any mobile device to allow immediate access to ongoing dialogue.

    <h3 class="panel-title">About the channels</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
<p>All channels will be moderated and facilitated by Think College staff, who will check in regularly, respond to questions, and encourage cross talk among each groups’ members. There is a general channel that everyone will be a part of, a TPSID only channel, an Intro to Slack channel, and then topic specific channels you can join.
</p>  </div>
</div>

<p><strong>Your Responsibilities:</strong>
Basically, we just ask that you play nice! Also, try to stay engaged: these conversations won't be as helpful if you don't participate. There is a formal <a href="coc.pdf">code of conduct</a>; however, the bottom line is to treat others as you wish to be treated. Be kind and considerate, and be respectful of others in the group. Conduct yourself as you would in any professional venue.</p>

<p>If you have any issues or questions, contact us at <a href="mailto:thinkcollege@umb.edu">thinkcollege@umb.edu</a>. Thanks for joining us!</p>



<!--<p>For example, staff from a program interested in becoming a Comprehensive Transition Program can join the “CTP channel” to get support and guidance from others interested in that specific topic. That person will also benefit from being a member of the “general” channel, where all users will come together to chat on broad topics related to inclusive higher education.  New channels can be added to support discussion and sharing on new topics of interest to the group.</p>

    Cindy Johnson, at ABC University, is beginning the process of establishing on-campus housing for students in their program. She has questions that her
    colleagues in the field may be able to help with. She logs onto Slack </a> and…

<p>
    <strong>Cindy Johnson:</strong> I am just starting to work on the relationships I will need to set up campus housing for the students in my program. Should I start with the
    Residence Life Office or the Disability Services office?

    <strong>Bob Duffy:</strong> At my university, we…. I know <strong>@Scott Smith</strong> has done things differently though.

<p><strong>General</strong> (moderated by Rebecca Lazo): This is a more casual forum; the purpose of this channel is to share general announcements, ask questions not applicable to existing channels, and just chat.  New channels can be requested here as well.</p>

<p><strong>TPSID</strong> chat (moderated by Molly Boyle): This channel is private, only accessible by TPSID program staff; otherwise, there are no specific parameters on topics.</p> 

<p><strong>CTP Application</strong> (moderated by Clare Papay): The purpose of this group is to discuss and share information about the comprehensive transition program application process.</p> 

<p><strong>Campus Housing</strong> (moderated by Carole Carlson): The purpose of this group is to discuss campus housing issues and share resources related to the development and operation of inclusive campus residential options.</p>
